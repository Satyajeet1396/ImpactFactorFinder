        **Assistant Professor Eligibility Score Calculator** helps candidates compute their academic, teaching, 
        and research scores based on official evaluation criteria.

        **Key Features:**
        - Calculates weighted scores for Academic Records (UG, PG, M.Phil., Ph.D., NET/SET/JRF)
        - Computes Teaching/Postdoc experience scores
        - Evaluates Research Aptitude & Innovation (Publications, Books/IPRs, Awards)
        - Provides a detailed summary table and final weighted score
        - Gives feedback based on score

        **How to Use:**
        1. Fill in your academic details in Section A.
        2. Enter your teaching or postdoctoral experience in Section B.
        3. Add research contributions in Section C.
        4. Review the final score and summary.
